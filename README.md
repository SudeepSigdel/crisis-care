This is the backend that I developed during my first hackathon. This is a disaster relief platform which helps in making the process of disaster management easier.
This was coded in the span of 36hrs. This was a while ago and there where a few modules that were depricated and some errors that I decided to fix now.
You can check the documentation for this at:
